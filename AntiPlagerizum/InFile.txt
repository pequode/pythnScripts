Unlike most malware, Stuxnet does little harm to computers and networks that do not meet specific configuration requirements; 
"The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hit... It was a marksman's job."[47] While the
 worm is promiscuous, it makes itself inert if Siemens software is not found on infected computers, and contains safeguards to prevent 
each infected computer from spreading the worm to more than three others, and to erase itself on 24 June 2012.[36]
For its targets, Stuxnet contains, among other things, code for a man-in-the-middle attack that fakes industrial process control sensor 
signals so an infected system does not shut down due to detected abnormal behavior.[36][47][48] Such complexity is very unusual for malware. 
The worm consists of a layered attack against three different systems:    The Windows operating system, Siemens PCS 7, WinCC and STEP7 industrial
 software applications that run on Windows and One or more Siemens S7 PLCs.  Windows infection Stuxnet attacked Windows systems using an unprecedented
four zero-day attacks (plus the CPLINK vulnerability and a vulnerability used by the Conficker worm[49]). It is initially spread using infected removable
 drives such as USB flash drives,[19][43] which contain Windows shortcut files to initiate executable code.[50] The worm then uses other exploits and 
techniques such as peer-to-peer RPC to infect and update other computers inside private networks that are not directly connected to the Internet.
[51][52][53] The number of zero-day exploits used is unusual, as they are highly valued and malware creators do not typically make use of 
(and thus simultaneously make visible) four different zero-day exploits in the same worm.[21] Amongst these exploits were remote code execution on a 
computer with Printer Sharing enabled,[54] and the LNK/PIF vulnerability,[55] in which file execution is accomplished when an icon is viewed in Windows Explorer;
 negating the need for user interaction.[56] Stuxnet is unusually large at half a megabyte in size,[51] and written in several different programming languages 
(including C and C++) which is also irregular for malware.[13][18][48] The Windows component of the malware is promiscuous in that it spreads relatively quickly 
and indiscriminately.[43] The malware has both user-mode and kernel-mode rootkit capability under Windows,[53] and its device drivers have been digitally signed 
with the private keys of two certificates that were stolen from separate well-known companies, JMicron and Realtek, both located at Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan.
[43][51] The driver signing helped it install kernel-mode rootkit drivers successfully without users being notified, and therefore it remained undetected for a 
elatively long period of time.[57] Both compromised certificates have been revoked by Verisign.Two websites in Denmark and Malaysia were configured as command and 
control servers for the malware, allowing it to be updated, and for industrial espionage to be conducted by uploading information. Both of these domain names have 
subsequently been redirected by their DNS service provider to Dynadot as part of a global effort to disable the malware.[53][36]
