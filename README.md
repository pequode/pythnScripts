# Scripts

## Description:
This repo is used for all the little misc projects I do for personal hacks. It is far less commented than my other repos but it helps me figure out how to solve problems I haven't dealt with in a while.
## Purpose:
I needed a place to store all of the projects I worked on through out the years. These are all small python scripts that I have used to solve some task.
## Contents
 - AntiPlagerizum

  A script written to test the capabilities of similarity testers. The idea behind this project was to see if there was a need to improve the current state of plagiarism checking. I noticed that TurnItIn.com only flagged my quoted text as plagiarism and not my paraphrased text. The hope is to one day implement a GAN to make a better plagiarism detector using a program like this as the Generator.

- CV Stuff

  A project to do computer vision tracking with OpenCV. It is currently one of my oldest scripts. It was used to provide location data for a program that I developed while working for IPPAS. I also used this program to learn how to create classes.

- Cyber Security Helper Functions

  This dir consists of small files that I used very situationally to solve specific Cyber Security challenges. These scripts are not very robust but,like many of the files in this repo, are meant to give me context on how to solve future challenges I may face.   

- kiviDev

  This was a small experiment to use Kivi to create a mobile app that would play a recording. It turned out halfway through that the module that allowed mic access for the app I wanted was outdated and didn't work. I then abandoned the project but it is still good reference for how to use kivi

- BotC.py,copyMe.py

  This is a program that is used as an auto clicker. It uses windows mouse input and follows a preset list of instruction.

- FileRenamer-Copy.py

  This is a file designed to rename all the files in a directory. It helps with naming camera image files more verbosely.It was also my first exploration with both input and file-system navigation.

- passGen.py

  This is a small program to randomly generate passwords for me. I wrote this myself because I was interested in controlling my random password generation.



### Goal:
To experiment with python, To explore new programming libraries and concepts.
